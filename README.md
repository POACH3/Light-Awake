# Light Awake
Less of a passion project and more of a necessity, this project was born out of my despise of being jolted awake by obnoxious audio alarms and tripping in the dark in the middle of the night.

The alarm simulates a sunrise in order to assist with a smoother wake-up routine-- specifically during times of the year with reduced daylight hours. During night time hours, the LEDs provide soft red lighting upon motion activation in order to facilitate navigation while maintaining night vision.


## Hardware:
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano
- RTC module: DS3231
- Motion sensor: HC-SR501 PIR
- LED strip: 5050 24V RGBW double row
- MOSFETs: IRLZ44N 47A 55V
- Buck converter: 5A 4-38V to 1.25-36V
